## About the Book

This is a web book I wrote because it felt fun when I thought about it -- a tutorial on Large Language Models for Music Information Retrieval. 

I've been working on acoustics, audio, music, machine learning, and AI since 2009 through various universities and companies. Early 2023, I decided to make a change towards language models and joined Genentech (Prescient Design team) to train and suffer from large language models. A year has passed, and I was fortunate to have learned some bit about LLMs by implementing, testing, evaluating, deploying, debugging, thinking, observing, wondering, and nightmare-ing.

LLMs seem powerful, but that may not be a strong reason to commit to them. 
But I believe LLMs are here to stay for good reasons.
This book is my invitation to the field and the ideas, hope you like it.

# LLMs <3 MIR

## About the Book

This is a web book I wrote because it felt fun when I thought about it. 

I've been working on acoustics, audio, music, machine learning, and AI since 2009 through various universities and companies. Early 2023, I decided to make a change towards language models and joined Genentech (Prescient Design team) to train and suffer from large language models. A year has passed, and I was fortunate to have learned some bit about LLMs by implementing, testing, evaluating, deploying, debugging, thinking, observing, wondering, and nightmare-ing.

LLMs seem powerful, but that may not be a strong reason to commit to them. 
But I believe LLMs are here to stay for good reasons.
This book is my invitation to the field and the ideas, hope you like it.   

## Scope

This book is written in the perspective of music AI. 

The intro (Chapter 1) would be general and succinct. I'll outsource a lot by simply sharing links so that you decide the depth and breadth of your study.

As a music AI person, you'll find the later chapters more interesting. 

Ok, then..

Let's go 🥁
